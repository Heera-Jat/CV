    <h1 id="heading"> I love cricket</h1>
    <p>Cricket is played by two teams of 11,
         with one side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs,
          while the other team will bowl and field the ball to
           restrict the opposition from scoring. <br>The main 
           objective in cricket is to score as many runs as possible 
           against the opponent.</p>
